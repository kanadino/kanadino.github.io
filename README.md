## FAQs
1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
  - 
2. Why is my resume not showing up?
  - Since the GitHub needs at least 10 minutes to change the site if we did any changes in our resume. It will also need at least 1 hour to create the GitHub Pages which is our static site if we have not one GitHub Pages.
